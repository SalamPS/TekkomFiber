This project made to fulfill one of my Final Project Assignment. Feel free to utilize it ðŸ™Œ

## Installation

See the [Bun Docs][bun] for the current version of Bun. I used [Vite][vite] to initialize react-app.

Install dependencies:
```
bun i
```

Run in dev mode:
```
bun run dev
```

I didn't include any `scene.bin`, `scene.gltf` and `textures` of the 3D assets in this repo, so it might return error if you try to run it.

There are two options to solve this:
- Download required files from the link provided in the `license.txt` inside of public folder
- Download different assets and change their paths on `Viewer.jsx`

## License

MIT

Thanks to all my friends for helping me finish this project. Cheers! ðŸ¥‚
