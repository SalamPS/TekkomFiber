# Tekkom x ThreeFiber

This webpage serves as an informative platform, providing detailed explanations about the different components of a computer through the use of 3D simulations using React ThreeFiber accompanied by comprehensive descriptions. 

By exploring the interactive 3D objects, users can delve into the intricate details of each computer component, gaining insights into their visual attributes and functionalities. Whether it's understanding the physical appearance or comprehending the specific roles and operations of these components, this platform offers a comprehensive learning experience for individuals eager to expand their knowledge of computer systems.

Moreover, this platform provides a valuable tool for educators, enabling them to teach computer hardware components effectively. Instructors can seamlessly integrate 3D models and detailed explanations into their lessons.

This project made to fulfill one of my Final Project Assignment. Feel free to utilize it üôå

## Installation

See the [Docs][bun] for the guide to Bun. I used [Next JS][next] to initialize react-app and applying Server-Side Rendering.

Install dependencies:
```
bun i
```

Run in dev mode:
```
bun run dev
```

Since this Project Deployed using vercel, this branch include the whole `scene.bin`, `scene.gltf` and `textures` of the 3D assets in this branch, so it might not return error from now on üëç.
