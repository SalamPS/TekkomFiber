[![Node](https://img.shields.io/node/v/vite)][node] [!Bun](bun-v1.0.16-f472b6)[bun]

## Installation

See the [Bun Docs][bun] for the current version of Bun. I used [Vite][vite] to initialize react-app.

Install dependencies:
```
bun i
```

Run in dev mode:
```
bun run dev
```

I didn't include any `scene.bin`, `scene.gltf` and `textures` of the 3D assets in this branch, so it might return error if you try to run it right away.

There are two options to solve this:
- Download required files from the link provided in the `license.txt` inside of public folder
- Download different assets and change their paths on `Viewer.jsx`

You also able to see and clone the build edition of this Repo on [TekkomFiber: Deploy][deploy]
